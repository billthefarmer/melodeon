Hold the tablet facing away from you the right way up. Play the buttons, touching the vertical grey bar as the bellows. If you don't know how to play button accordion, see http://info.melodeon.net. The buttons may be reversed using the slide button at the bottom.

### External Keyboard
An external USB or Bluetooth keyboard may be used. The keys are...
```

The spacebar, left and right shift keys and left and right control keys
act as the bellows. The function keys and number keys act as the bass
buttons.
